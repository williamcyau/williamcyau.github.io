I am honored to be advised by <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChanGroup/stanleychan.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Stanley Chan</a>. I work in the field of computational imaging, with a particular interest in the intersection between optics, photonics, and deep learning.</p> <p>Prior to joining Purdue, I finished my Bachelor’s in Physics and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I was brought into the fantastic field of computational imaging by the mentorship from <a href="https://www.laurawaller.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Laura Waller</a> and <a href="https://lakabuli.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Leyla Kabuli</a>. Prior to this, I did reseach on jet reconstruction algorithms at LBNL, and space plasma physics at SSL.</p> <p>Outside of research, I enjoy <a href="https://wyauphoto.mypixieset.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">editorial photography</a> and Jazz music.</p> </body></html>
