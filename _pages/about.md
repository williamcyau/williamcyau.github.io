I am a first-year PhD student at Purdue University's [Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) Department. I am honored to be advised by [Prof. Stanley Chan](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChanGroup/stanleychan.html). I work in the field of computational imaging, with a particular interest in the intersection between optics, photonics, and deep learning. 

Prior to joining Purdue, I finished my Bachelor's in Physics and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I was brought into the fantastic field of computational imaging by the mentorship from [Prof. Laura Waller](https://www.laurawaller.com/) and [Leyla Kabuli](https://lakabuli.github.io/). Prior to this, I did reseach on jet reconstruction algorithms at LBNL, and space plasma physics at SSL.

Outside of research, I enjoy [editorial photography](https://wyauphoto.mypixieset.com/) and Jazz music.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
