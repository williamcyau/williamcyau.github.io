  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={Analysis and Improvement of Rank-Ordered Mean Algorithm in Single-Photon LiDAR}, 
  year={2024},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Depth estimation using a single-photon LiDAR is often solved by a matched filter. It is, however, error-prone in the presence of background noise. A commonly used technique to reject background noise is the rank-ordered mean (ROM) filter previously reported by Shin et al. (2015). ROM rejects noisy photon arrival timestamps by selecting only a small range of them around the median statistics within its local neighborhood. Despite the promising performance of ROM, its theoretical performance limit is unknown. In this paper, we theoretically characterize the ROM performance by showing that ROM fails when the reflectivity drops below a threshold predetermined by the depth and signal-to-background ratio, and its accuracy undergoes a phase transition at the cutoff. Based on our theory, we propose an improved signal extraction technique by selecting tight timestamp clusters. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves depth estimation performance over ROM by 3 orders of magnitude at the same signal intensities, and achieves high image fidelity at noise levels as high as 17 times that of signal. The code for this project is made available at https://github.com/yauwilliam69/NCFforLiDAR.git.},
